#To Make
make : 		To compile myprun and mypkill
make demo : 	To compile myprun and mypkill if not already compiled and
	    	executing ./myprun -f machinefile -np 12 test.c
make clean : 	Remove myprun and mypkill

#To Run
./myprun -np NumProcesses -f Machinefile ProgramToExecute
./mypkill -np -f Machinefile PatternToKill

# Programs
test.c : A basic program which displays the TSIZE and MYID environment variables
ptest.c : A program with pause() function call to simulate a program which has hung.

#Details
myprun : 	Uses execve to create child processes and runs the program
		passed in the arguments	on the machines listed in the machinefile.
		Arguments: 1] -np Number of Processes (default = 1)
			   2] -f Machinefile (default = machinefile)
			   3] Program to execute

mypkill:	Uses execve to create child processes and kills the programs
		matching the pattern passed in the arguments the machines 
		listed in the machinefile.
		Arguments: 1] -f Machinefile (default = machinefile)
			   2] pattern to kill

#Demo
myprun :  To see a demo of myprun , just run it using similar syntax as
	  ./myprun -f machinefile -np 12 test.c

mypkill : To see a demo of mypkill, run myprun with ptest.c (A program which executes pause()
	  and never completes). Open another terminal and run mypkill which will terminate the
	  incomplete processes executed by myprun.
