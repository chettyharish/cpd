Behavior:
--> Enter guest mode by pressing Enter key at username
--> Guests cannot make duplicate accounts with same username
--> Once a user is blocked, there is no way they can communicate till they are unblocked
--> Register only works for guests
--> You can win, lose or draw in a game.
--> There is a limit of 50 users in total
--> There is a limit of 50 games in total
--> There is a limit of 20 mails per user
--> There is a limit of 50 blocked users per user
--> The rating is defined by Wins/(Wins+Losses+Draws)
--> The data is backed up after every command
--> The game diffs time and tests whether a player
	 has timed-out when he plays a move.
--> The database uses special characters as delimiters.
--> Every user has an entry in ttt_registry_table for login management
--> Every user has a file named ttt_username with all his data

Changes:
--> We have used aditional headers to make it usable in GUI Client
--> The GUI client can do everything which the terminal version can
--> All the information is sent in single messages to guide the client
