#To Compile:
Use make to compile all 3 files
seq.c --> Original sequentail GOE
omp.c --> Carries out GOE using openmp
thread.c --> Carries out GOE using multi-threading.
process.c --> Carries out GOE using multi-processing.

#To run
Use the form ./program_name num_rows num_cols [options]
e.g :
./process 1000 1000
./process 1000 1000 -d 20 -n 8
./omp 1000 1000 -d 20
./thread 1000 1000 -d 20 -n 32

#Testing
All the three different tests compile run and diff-check the output.
diff checks the lines to ensure that they are exactly the same.
Every programs output is redirected to a file test[programname] (e.g testomp).
Every programs final world is redirected to a file final_world[programname].txt (e.g. final_worldomp.txt).

--> Use 'make simpledemo' to test the working of all programs
--> Use 'make boundarydemo' to test boundaries which ensures that all
	boundaries are correct. There are 5 different tests.
	The first tests the boundaries for prime numbers.
	The second tests the boundaries for a single column.
	The third tests the boundaries for a single row.
	The fourth tests the boundaries for a single element.
	The fifth tests the boundaries for a small matrix.
--> Use 'make debugdemo' to test out for debugger print . Uses a small example to run the code quickly.
