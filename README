##README

The new_test_makefile has various tests to try out all the differet features using variety of targets. Some of the tests
only work with the supplied files as they use these files as input.

pipetest: Used for testing pipes, carries out various operations using 1,2,3,4 and 5 piped processed 
	  (The program can support 50 piped processed, and the number is modifiable by changing the NUMELE macro in code )
multiline: Uses the sample directory and outputs the makefile inside tempor/new. Ensures that the cd works for cat.
interrupt: Executes sleep for 15 seconds, good for testing the NO INTERRUPT -i flag.
backtest: Executes two sleeps, first is background and next is not. Also good for testing killing children.
alarmtest: Executes sleep for 100 seconds, food for testing the ALARM -t flag.
redrouttest: Tests IO Redirection to a file.
redrintest: Tests IO Redirection from a file.
bothredrtest: Tests IO Redirection for both input and output.
echotest : Test for echo command
simple.o: For testing timestamp based compilation
.c.o : Inference to make target.o from target.c
.cpp : Inference to make target from target.cpp
first/second/third/fourth/fifth/sixth && test1/test2/test3 : Tests whethere Cyclic Redundancies and ordering is correct
mixtest: Handles case of absolute and dynamic command path
pipeerror: A simple pipe command to crash pipes
cderror: Testing execution with wrong cd paths
errortest: Testing wrong command without a file
errortest2: Testing piped wrong commands with no files
errortest3: Testing wrong targets
errorredr: IO Redirected input from missing file


##Sample executions
./mymake pipetest
./mymake multiline
./mymake interrupt -i
./mymake backtest (You can test that both processes are running concurrently by carrying out a ps)
./mymake alarmtest -t 5
./mymake redrouttest -d
./mymake redrintest -d
./mymake bothredrtest -i
./mymake echotest
./mymake simple.o
./mymake temp.o (Uses .c.o inference rule)
./mymake temp2 (Uses .cpp inference rule)
./mymake first
./mymake mixtest
./mymake pipeerror -k
./mymake cderror
./mymake errortest
./mymake errortest2
./mymake errortest3
./mymake errorredr


The program has been tested hoping that there are no bugs . If you find one, please message me :) I would like to know where!
