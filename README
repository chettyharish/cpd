#To Compile:
Use make to compile all 3 files
seq.c --> Original sequentail GOE
omp.c --> Carries out GOE using openmp
thread.c --> Carries out GOE using multi-threading.
process.c --> Carries out GOE using multi-processing.
seq_debug.c --> seq.c with debugging ON.
omp_debug.c --> omp.c with debugging ON.
thread_debug.c --> thread.c with debugging ON.
process_debug.c --> process.c with debugging ON.

#To run
Use the form ./program_name num_rows num_cols
e.g :
./process 1000 1000
./omp 1000 1000
./thread 1000 1000

#Testing
All the three different tests compile run and diff-check the output.
diff checks the lines to ensure that they are exactly the same.
Every programs output is redirected to a file test(programname).
Every programs final world is redirected to a file final_world(programname).txt.

--> Use 'make simpledemo' to test the working of all programs
--> Use 'make primedemo' to test boundaries which ensures that all
	boundaries are correct (Since prime numbers are not divisible)
--> Use 'make debugdemo' to test out for debugger print . This uses the debugging
	version of the code which has DEBUG_LEVEL > 10.
