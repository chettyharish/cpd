##README

Files:
server_king : The main executable which you have to run
client_king : The clients run this (Do not run this executable)
answertester : A code which compares two ascii answer files

Compiling:
Use make to compile both the client and the server code.

Cleaning:
Use make clean to remove all the executable files

Requirements:
Requires 9 sockets numbers in sequence which are free.
Requires machinefile with 8 rsa-authenticate machine (It would be easier to use cop5570c, as
	it already has all the machines authenticated named m1 to m9.)

Running the code:
use the following syntax to run the code
./server_king large_file_name current_ip_address machinefile start_socket
	large_file_name : the full path with filename for the file with 8 Billion long int's.
	current_ip_address: The IP address of the computer where you are running the code.
	machinefile: List of 8 machines which are authenticated for direct ssh.
	start_socket: Uses sockets from the start_socket value to start_socket + 8 for the 9 machines.
Example: time  ./server_king ../cop5570a/test0 192.168.28.124 machinefile

Output:
-->The server_king writes back every 10th element to create the file final_answer.
-->The code will not output anything ( Since it causes a wastage of 2 minutes).
	It is possible to turn them ON by uncommenting two lines in the server_king code.
	//#define printf(...)
	//#define set_time(...)
	These lines force printf and set_time change to empty lines. By uncommenting, they will print
	a lot of data and timing information.
-->The client_king's generate a log while executing (which is removed at termination)

Working:
The server_king code acts as the data reader and distributor to clients. 
It reads the file parallely and trasfers chunks of 850M elements to each of the clients.
The clients carry out the task of sorting their part and sending it back to the server.
The server itself works as a client and processes 1.2B elements. (1.2B + 850M*8 = 8B).
Finally the server carries out the job of carrying out a 9 way merge ( 8 from sockets one from memory).
