Test: 
Try sending mail to guest user.
Check what happens when we reregister same user.
When user relogins will he lose the game.
What is the second number there for a match?

observe/unobserve seems to have bugs in it.
if i unobserve game 0 game 2 gets unobserved
refresh is showing all games...(after mail arrived)
