If game is won in a particular move display who won to all players and observers, end game and update stats.
(Good trick for determinig if someone won a game.)
2	7	6
9	5	1
4	3	8

Check if sum of any 3 of the users moves results in 15. if so he has won!



Test: 
Try sending mail to guest user.
Check what happens when we reregister same user.
When user relogins will he lose the game.
What is the second number there for a match?

observe/unobserve seems to have bugs in it.
if i unobserve game 0 game 2 gets unobserved
refresh is showing all games...(after mail arrived)
